In accepting this license, You acknowledge that all Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensed Materials are and will remain the sole property of Symica and/or it licensors.

Upon payment of the applicable license fees, Symica hereby grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: use the Licensed Materials, solely for the design, simulation, and implementation of User Products; and subject to all of Permitted Uses and the site and other restrictions set forth in this EULA.
 2.3.	Evaluation Version. If Symica identifies the Licensed Materials as a demonstration, evaluation, trial, “not for sale” (“NFS”) or “not for resale” (“NFR”) version (“Evaluation Version”) in the applicable User Documentation or license obtained from Symica, you may Install and Access the Software only for the purpose of evaluation and demonstration. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not use it for competitive analysis, or commercial, professional, or other for-profit purposes. The Evaluation Version may only be Installed for a thirty (30) day evaluation period or the time period defined in license obtained from Symica, unless otherwise specified by Symica in writing.
 2.4.	Restrictions on Use. This EULA grants You the right to install and use the Licensed Materials only upon or in connection with a single computer or a single Local Area Network, at a single geographic site, depending upon the terms under which You have licensed the Licensed Materials from Symica. In the event that You have not licensed any Licensed Materials from Symica Your use thereof must be confined to a single computer or a single Local Area Network at a single geographic site.

In no event shall You: a) allow any of Your affiliates, subsidiaries or divisions, or any portion of Your business located at a different geographic site, or any third party, to have access to or use any portion whatsoever of the Licensed Materials; b) make copies of the Licensed Materials for use by any of Your other affiliates, subsidiaries or divisions, or by any third party; c) allow more than the number of permitted persons to access and use the Licensed Materials at any one time, (whether involving a single license or a license that allows multiple users) unless you have negotiated with Symica for a license that permits an unlimited number of users to access and use the Licensed Materials.
 2.4.2.	In the event that You have licensed the Licensed Materials for use in connection with a single computer, You may install and use only a single copy thereof at any given time, and said copy may be used only by You; provided, however, that if You have licensed the Licensed Materials for use on a single computer you may make a back-up, archival copy thereof that You shall install only in the event the original copy of the Licensed Materials is lost, corrupted or in some other way made unavailable other than through use or possession by another person.

At no time shall You permit the number of persons that may access and/or use the Licensed Materials to exceed the number of persons for whom You have licensed the same.

ENGAGING IN ANY USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS BY PERSONS BEYOND THE NUMBER PERMITTED TO USE THE SAME OR BY PERSONS NOT AUTHORIZED UNDER YOUR LICENSE TO USE THEM SHALL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THIS EULA, WHETHER OR NOT SYMICA IS AWARE OF YOUR ACTIVITIES AT THE TIME OR DISCOVERS THEM LATER. ANY FURTHER USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS BY YOU SUBSEQUENT TO SUCH TERMINATION WILL EXPOSE YOU TO LIABILITY FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER CLAIMS.
 2.4.4.	You may increase the number of persons permitted to use the Licensed Materials at any one time by paying Symica additional license fees in accordance with then-applicable pricing, provided that such additional persons in no way access or use the Licensed Materials prior to any such additional license fees being paid by You.

In the event that any provision of this EULA is breached by You, the license granted herein shall automatically terminate, without further action by Symica and whether or not You abide by such termination. Failure of Symica to learn about any such breach shall not constitute a basis for You to assert that You are not in breach hereof, or that Symica has acquiesced in such breach.
